    Hello! I'm Logan MacConnell. I am from Iowa and as a result I love corn! I was practically born in it!
    I am here to learn more about web development and design. I hope to eventually graduate and start a career in programming!
    I enjoy music, speaking portuguese, hanging out with friends and learning new things!
